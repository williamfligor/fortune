  "\nThe most exquisite peak in culinary art is conquered when you do right by a\nham, for a ham, in the very nature of the process it has undergone since last\nit walked on its own feet, combines in its flavor the tang of smoky autumnal\nwoods, the maternal softness of earthy fields delivered of their crop children,\nthe wineyness of a late sun, the intimate kiss of fertilizing rain, and the\nbite of fire.  You must slice it thin, almost as thin as this page you hold\nin your hands.  The making of a ham dinner, like the making of a gentleman,\nstarts a long, long time before the event.\n\t\t-- W.B. Courtney, \"Reflections of Maryland Country Ham\",\n\t\t   from \"Congress Eate It Up\"\n",

  "\nThe reason it's called \"Grape Nuts\" is that it contains \"dextrose\", which is\nalso sometimes called \"grape sugar,\" and also because \"Grape Nuts\" is\ncatchier, in terms of marketing, than \"A Cross Between Gerbil Food and\nGravel,\" which is what it tastes like.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"Tips for Writer's\"\n",
  "\nThe scene: in a vast, painted desert, a cowboy faces his horse.\n\nCowboy:\t\"Well, you've been a pretty good hoss, I guess.  Hardworkin'.\n\tNot the fastest critter I ever come acrost, but...\"\n\nHorse:  \"No, stupid, not feed*back*.  I said I wanted a feed*bag*.\n",

  "\nThere are three possible parts to a date, of which at least two must be\noffered: entertainment, food, and affection. It is customary to begin a\nseries of dates with a great deal of entertainment, a moderate amount of\nfood, and the merest suggestion of affection. As the amount of affection\nincreases, the entertainment can be reduced proportionately. When the\naffection IS the entertainment, we no longer call it dating. Under no\ncircumstances can the food be omitted.\n\t\t-- Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behaviour\n",

  "\n\t... This striving for excellence extends into people's personal\nlives as well.  When '80s people buy something, they buy the best one, as\ndetermined by (1) price and (2) lack of availability. Eighties people buy\nimported dental floss.  They buy gourmet baking soda.  If an '80s couple\ngoes to a restaurant where they have made a reservation three weeks in\nadvance, and they are informed that their table is available, they stalk\nout immediately, because they know it is not an excellent restaurant.  If\nit were, it would have an enormous crowd of excellence-oriented people\nlike themselves waiting, their beepers going off like crickets in the\nnight.  An excellent restaurant wouldn't have a table ready immediately\nfor anybody below the rank of Liza Minnelli.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"In Search of Excellence\"\n",
  "\n\tTo lose weight, eat less; to gain weight, eat more; if you merely\nwish to maintain, do whatever you were doing.\n\tThe Bronx diet is a legitimate system of food therapy showing that\nfood SHOULD be used a crutch and which food could be the most effective in\npromoting spiritual and emotional satisfaction.  For the first time, an\neater could instantly grasp the connection between relieving depression and\nMallomars, and understand why a lover's quarrel isn't so bad if there's a\npint of ice cream nearby.\n\t\t-- Richard Smith, \"The Bronx Diet\"\n",
  "\nTo see the butcher slap the steak, before he laid it on the block,\nand give his knife a sharpening, was to forget breakfast instantly.  It was\nagreeable, too -- it really was -- to see him cut it off, so smooth and juicy.\nThere was nothing savage in the act, although the knife was large and keen;\nit was a piece of art, high art; there was delicacy of touch, clearness of\ntone, skilful handling of the subject, fine shading.  It was the triumph of\nmind over matter; quite.\n\t\t-- Dickens, \"Martin Chuzzlewit\"\n",

  "\nToo Late\n\tA large number of turkies [sic] went to San Francisco yesterday by\nthe two o'clock boats.

  "\nWithout ice cream life and fame are meaningless.\n",
  "\nYou can always tell the Christmas season is here when you start getting\nincredibly dense, tinfoil-and-ribbon- wrapped lumps in the mail. Fruitcakes\nmake ideal gifts because the Postal Service has been unable to find a way to\ndamage them.  They last forever, largely because nobody ever eats them.  In\nfact, many smart people save the fruitcakes they receive and send them back\nto the original givers the next year; some fruitcakes have been passed back\nand forth for hundreds of years.\n\nThe easiest way to make a fruitcake is to buy a darkish cake, then pound\nsome old, hard fruit into it with a mallet.

  "\nYou should tip the waiter $10, minus $2 if he tells you his name, another $2\nif he claims it will be His Pleasure to serve you and another $2 for each\n\"special\" he describes involving confusing terms such as \"shallots,\" and $4\nif the menu contains the word \"fixin's.\" In many restaurants, this means the\nwaiter will actually owe you money. If you are traveling with a child aged\nsix months to three years, you should leave an additional amount equal to\ntwice the bill to compensate for the fact that they will have to take the\nbanquette out and burn it because the cracks are wedged solid with gobbets\nmade of partially chewed former restaurant rolls saturated with baby spit.\n\nIn New York, tip the taxicab driver $40 if he does not mention his hemorrhoids.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"The Stuff of Etiquette\"\n",
