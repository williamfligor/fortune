They hired the best speech\ntherapists, doctors, psychiatrists, all to no avail.  The child simply refused\nto speak.

  "\nWe are the people our parents warned us about.\n",
  "\nWhat really shapes and conditions and makes us is somebody only a few of\nus ever have the courage to face: and that is the child you once were,\nlong before formal education ever got its claws into you -- that\nimpatient, all-demanding child who wants love and power and can't get\nenough of either and who goes on raging and weeping in your spirit till\nat last your eyes are closed and all the fools say, \"Doesn't he look\npeaceful?\" It is those pent-up, craving children who make all the wars\nand all the horrors and all the art and all the beauty and discovery in\nlife, because they are trying to achieve what lay beyond their grasp\nbefore they were five years old.\n\t\t-- Robertson Davies, \"The Rebel Angels\"\n",

Just\npicture the scene in your living room on Christmas morning as your children\nopen their old-fashioned presents.\n\nYour 11-year-old son: \"What the heck is this?\"\n\nYou:\t\"A spinning top!  You spin it around, and then eventually it falls\ndown.  What fun!  Ha, ha!\"\n\nSon:\t\"Is this a joke?  Jason Thompson's parents got him a computer with \ntwo disk drives and 128 kilobytes of random-access memory, and I get this \ncretin TOP?\"\n\nYour 8-year-old daughter: \"You think that's bad?  Look at this.\"\n\nYou:\t\"It's figgy pudding!  What a treat!\"\n\nDaughter: \"It looks like goat barf.\"\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, \"Simple, Homespun Gifts\"\n",
