In court he will plead\nthat he was depressed because society had failed him, and that he was\nlooking for Mother Teresa for comfort and to offer his services to the\npoor.  In that lawsuit, you will lose.  If, on the other hand, you kill\nhim, the most that you can expect is that a relative will bring a wrongful\ndeath action. You will have two advantages: first, there be only your\nstory; forget Mother Teresa.  Second, even if you lose, how much could\nthe bum's life be worth anyway?  A Lot less than 50 years worth of\nparalysis.  Don't play George Bush and Saddam Hussein.  Finish the job.\n\t-- G. Gordon Liddy's \"Forbes\" column on personal security\n",
