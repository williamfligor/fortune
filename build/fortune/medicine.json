  "A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:\n\n1. DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT.\n\tInvolvement with the patient's suffering might cause him to lose\n\tvaluable scientific objectivity.\n\n2. BE CHEERFUL AT ALL TIMES.\n\tYour doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all the\n\tgentleness and reassurance he can get.\n\n3. TRY TO SUFFER FROM THE DISEASE FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEING TREATED.\n\tRemember that your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold.\n",
  "\nA CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:\n\n4. DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THE TREATMENT FAILS TO BRING RELIEF.\n\tYou must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight into\n\tthe true nature of your illness, which transcends any mere permanent\n\tdisability you may have experienced.\n\n5. NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR WHY HE IS DOING IT.\n\tIt is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be\n\texplained in terms that you would understand.\n\n6. SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMANTAL TREATMENT READILY.\n\tThough the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting\n\tresearch paper will surely be of widespread interest.\n",
  "\nA CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS:\n\n7. PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY.\n\tYou should consider it a privilege to contribute, however modestly,\n\tto the well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.\n\n8. DO NOT SUFFER FROM AILMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD.\n\tIt is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your means.\n\n9. NEVER REVEAL ANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE\n   OF TREATMENT BY YOUR DOCTOR.\n\tThe patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a\n\tsacred duty to protect him from exposure.\n\n10. NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS DIRECT CARE.\n\tThis will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.\n",
  "\nA distraught patient phoned her doctor's office.  \"Was it true,\" the woman\ninquired, \"that the medication the doctor had prescribed was for the rest\nof her life?\"\n\tShe was told that it was.  There was just a moment of silence before\nthe woman proceeded bravely on.  \"Well, I'm wondering, then, how serious my\ncondition is.  This prescription is marked `NO REFILLS'\".\n",
  "\nA doctor calls his patient to give him the results of his tests.  \"I have\nsome bad news,\" says the doctor, \"and some worse news.\"  The bad news is\nthat you only have six weeks to live.\"\n\t\"Oh, no,\" says the patient.  \"What could possibly be worse than that?\"\n\t\"Well,\" the doctor replies, \"I've been trying to reach you since\nlast Monday.\"\n",

  "\nA woman went into a hospital one day to give birth.  Afterwards, the doctor\ncame to her and said, \"I have some... odd news for you.\"\n\t\"Is my baby all right?\" the woman anxiously asked.\n\t\"Yes, he is,\" the doctor replied, \"but we don't know how.  Your son\n(we assume) was born with no body.  He only has a head.\"\n\tWell, the doctor was correct.  The Head was alive and well, though no\none knew how.  The Head turned out to be fairly normal, ignoring his lack of\na body, and lived for some time as typical a life as could be expected under\nthe circumstances.\n\tOne day, about twenty years after the fateful birth, the woman got a\nphone call from another doctor.  The doctor said, \"I have recently perfected\nan operation.  Your son can live a normal life now: we can graft a body onto\nhis head!\"\n\tThe woman, practically weeping with joy, thanked the doctor and hung\nup.  She ran up the stairs saying, \"Johnny, Johnny, I have a *wonderful*\nsurprise for you!\"\n\t\"Oh no,\" cried The Head, \"not another HAT!\"\n",
  "\nAfter his legs had been broken in an accident, Mr. Miller sued for damages, \nclaming that he was crippled and would have to spend the rest of his life\nin a wheelchair.  Although the insurance-company doctor testified that his\nbones had healed properly and that he was fully capable  of walking, the\njudge decided for the plaintiff and awarded him $500,000.\n\tWhen he was wheeled into the insurance office to collect his check,\nMiller was confronted by several executives.  \"You're not getting away with\nthis, Miller,\" one said.  \"We're going to watch you day and night.  If you\ntake a single step, you'll not only repay the damages but stand trial for\nperjury.  Here's the money.  What do you intend to do with it?\"\n\t\"My wife and I are going to travel,\" Miller replied.  \"We'll go to\nStockholm, Berlin, Rome, Athens and, finally, to a place called Lourdes --\nwhere, gentlemen, you'll see yourselves one hell of a miracle.\"\n",

  "\nAquavit is also considered useful for medicinal purposes, an essential\ningredient in what I was once told is the Norwegian cure for the common\ncold.

  "\n\tAs a general rule of thumb, never trust anybody who's been in therapy\nfor more than 15 percent of their life span.  The words \"I am sorry\" and \"I\nam wrong\" will have totally disappeared from their vocabulary.  They will stab\nyou, shoot you, break things in your apartment, say horrible things to your\nfriends and family, and then justify this abhorrent behavior by saying:\n\"Sure, I put your dog in the microwave.  But I feel *better* for doing it.\"\n\t\t-- Bruce Feirstein, \"Nice Guys Sleep Alone\"\n",
  "\nAt the hospital, a doctor is training an intern on how to announce bad news\nto the patients.  The doctor tells the intern \"This man in 305 is going to\ndie in six months.  Go in and tell him.\"  The intern boldly walks into the\nroom, over to the man's bedisde and tells him \"Seems like you're gonna die!\"\nThe man has a heart attack and is rushed into surgery on the spot.  The doctor\ngrabs the intern and screams at him, \"What!?!? are you some kind of moron?\nYou've got to take it easy, work your way up to the subject.  Now this man in\n213 has about a week to live.  Go in and tell him, but, gently, you hear me,\ngently!\"\n\tThe intern goes softly into the room, humming to himself, cheerily\nopens the drapes to let the sun in, walks over to the man's bedside, fluffs\nhis pillow and wishes him a \"Good morning!\"  \"Wonderful day, no?

  "\nFor my son, Robert, this is proving to be the high-point of his entire life\nto date.  He has had his pajamas on for two, maybe three days now.
