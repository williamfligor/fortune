Don't fret too much, Taurus.  To get back on your feet\n\tsimply miss two car payments.\n\nGEMINI (May 21 - June 21)\n\tYou think you're falling in love with a person who has a lot in\n\tcommon with yourself.

Now your friends are coming and going and your\n\tenemies accumulating.  Cheer up!  All is not lost.  It's better to\n\tbe hated for what you are than loved for what you're not.\n",
