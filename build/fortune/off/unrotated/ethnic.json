If there was a\nnatural disaster, undoubtedly the English government was an accessory to\nthe fact, if not outrightly culpable.  Repeatedly, his superiors called him\non the carpet for his behavior.

  "\nWorld War III is about to break out, but hidden somewhere in Switzerland,\na small group of international statesmen are trying to avert disaster.\nThe key members of this group are the representatives from Moscow, Bonn, and\nJerusalem, who, despite their personal enmity, manage to forge a peaceful\nsettlement, at the last moment.  As the treaty is signed, and the war\npostponed, almost entirely through the efforts of those three men, an angel\nappears. \"The earth is saved through the efforts of these three men!\nTherefore, I will grant each of them their heart's desire!\"\n\tSo, the angel asks the German for his wish, and the German, recalling\nthe nearness of their disaster, and perceiving the cause to have been the\nRussians, immediately says \"I wish there were no more Russians!\"  And God\nsaid, \"It will be done.\"\n\tThe angel asks the Russian for his wish, which, of course, is \"*I*\nwish there were no more Germans!\"  Replies the angel, \"It will be done.\"\n\tSo the angel asks the Jew for his wish.  The Jew is in a state of\nshock. \"Will you really grant the German's wish?\" he asks, and the angel\navers.  \"And the Russian's, too?\"  The angel avers yet again.  Then the Jew\nthinks a moment, leans back and says, \"In that case, I think I'd like a small\ncup of coffee.\"\n",

If you are\nintroduced to a member of a minority group, use the \"high-five\" style\nhandshake, followed by a remark designed to show you don't mind a bit,\nsuch as \"I see you are a (name of a minority group)!
