  "\nYour conscience never stops you from doing anything.  It just stops you\nfrom enjoying it.\n",
  "\nYour friends will know you better in the first minute you meet than your\nacquaintances will know you in a thousand years.\n\t\t-- Richard Bach, \"Illusions\"\n",
  "\nYouth -- not a time of life but a state of mind... a predominance of\ncourage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.\n\t\t-- Robert F. Kennedy\n",
  "\nYouth is a blunder, manhood a struggle, old age a regret.\n\t\t-- Benjamin Disraeli, \"Coningsby\"\n",
  "\nYouth is a disease from which we all recover.\n\t\t-- Dorothy Fuldheim\n",
  "\n\tYouth is not a time of life, it is a state of mind; it is a temper of\nthe will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a predominance\nof courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over love of ease.\n\tNobody grows old by merely living a number of years; people grow\nold only by deserting their ideals.  Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up\nenthusiasm wrinkles the soul.  Worry, doubt, self-distrust, fear, and despair\n-- these are the long, long years that bow the head and turn the growing spirit\nback to dust.\n\tWhether seventy or sixteen, there is in every being's heart the love\nof wonder, the sweet amazement at the stars and the starlike things and\nthoughts, the undaunted challenge of events, the unfailing childlike appetite\nfor what next, and the joy and the game of life.\n\tYou are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your\nself-confidence, as old as your fear, as young as your hope, as old as your\ndespair.\n\tSo long as your heart receives messages of beauty, cheer, courage,\ngrandeur and power from the earth, from man, and from the Infinite, so long\nyou are young.\n\t\t-- Samuel Ullman\n",
