Put things back where you found them.  Clean up your own mess.\nDon't take things that aren't yours.   Say you're sorry when you hurt someone.\nWash your hands before you eat.  Flush.  Warm cookies and cold milk are good\nfor you.  Live a balanced life.

When you go out into the world, watch for\ntraffic, hold hands, and stick together.  Be aware of wonder.  Remember the\nlittle seed in the plastic cup.   The roots go down and the plant goes up and\nnobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.  Goldfish and\nhamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the plastic cup -- they all\ndie.
